 ## About the cproject
* DRL policy establishes a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for structural maintenance management by reformulating the problem as a standard control problem. 
* With the great power of nonlinear representation of the DNNs, it is able to handle the decision-making in structural maintenance of large complex structures.
* The code is the detail implementation of paper published on [Structural Safety].
* Two cases are provided here, the deck-system (for simple structures), and the long-span cable-stayed bridge (for complex structures).
